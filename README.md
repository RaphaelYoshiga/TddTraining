## Exercises

### Fizz Buzz

Write a method that receives an integer and returns the number as a string, but for multiples of three return "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five return "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five return "FizzBuzz".

### Leap year

Write a function that returns true or false depending on whether its input integer is a leap year or not. A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4, but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400. For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996 is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an atypical common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.

### Nth - Fibonacci

Write some code to generate the Fibonacci number for the nth position ex: 
int Fibonacci(int position)
First Fibonacci numbers in the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
